# File Structure Best Practices

Learn how to organize your project files effectively.

## Core Principles

1. **Single Responsibility**
   - Each file should have one clear purpose
   - Break down large files into focused modules
   - Keep files small and manageable

2. **Logical Grouping**
   - Group related files together
   - Use consistent naming conventions
   - Create clear folder hierarchies

3. **Module Organization**
   - Separate concerns into distinct modules
   - Use index files for public APIs
   - Keep internal implementation details private

## Recommended Structure

```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── common/
│   ├── features/
│   └── layouts/
├── hooks/
├── utils/
├── services/
├── types/
└── styles/
```

## Best Practices

1. **Component Organization**
   - Group components by feature or purpose
   - Keep related files close together
   - Use index files for exports

2. **Utility Functions**
   - Create focused utility files
   - Group related utilities
   - Write clear documentation

3. **Type Definitions**
   - Separate types into dedicated files
   - Use clear naming conventions
   - Keep types close to their usage
